# Avengers Unite - Hero Linuep
Created an app that allows the user create their own hero lineup with Marvel characters. 

User is given a search bar so that they can search for a Marvel character.

User is given the character name, the bio (if said hero has one listed in the Marvel API ie Gambit does not), an image of said hero, and any comics, movies/shows the character has been in.

User is presented with a save button that allows them to save up to six characters for their hero lineup.

The hero lineup will show the characters images.

If the user searches for a hero not found in the Marvel API (ie She-Hulk, Ant-Man etc) or it is not a character in the Marvel universe they will get a notification saying said character could not be found and/or verify the name was spelled exaclty how Marvel spells it.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bulma were used for the application.
